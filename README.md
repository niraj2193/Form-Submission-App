Dockerfile: WebApp/Dockerfile

Ports: Maps container port 80 to host port 3000

Network: app-network

Backend (.NET Web API)

Environment Variables:

ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development

ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection=InMemory

Ports: Maps container port 80 to host port 5075

Network: app-network

## Network
A custom bridge network named app-network is used to allow communication between the frontend and backend services.

# Form-Submission-App

This is the .NET 9 Web API backend and React Frontend for the User Form Application. It provides endpoints for submitting and retrieving user data and stores it in an in-memory database or PostgreSQL database depending on your configuration.

## Tech Stack

- .NET 9 (ASP.NET Core) for backend development
- Entity Framework Core for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
- Swagger for API documentation and Testing
- CORS configured to allow requests from a React frontend
- React (v18+)
- Material UI (MUI v5)
- Environment-based `fetch()` for API requests
